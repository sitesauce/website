			Does Sitesauce replace regular hosting?
			Can I run Sitesauce from my development or staging environment?
			Do I need to expose my backend to the internet to use Sitesauce?
			EOL,
            'answer' => <<<EOL
			While it's recommended to keep an instance of your backend running somewhere (like a subdomain), as it allows you to continue using your dashboard regularly, you can deploy locally-running sites to Sitesauce using [our CLI](https://sitesauce.app/guides/cli)!<br><br>\n
			This means you could have a WordPress blog on your computer, run it locally to edit some content then push it to production via Sitesauce without needing to host the backend anywhere.
			EOL,
        ], [
            'question' => 'How does Sitesauce detect when my content changes?',
            'answer' => <<<EOL
			Sitesauce provides official plugins for many content managing platforms (like WordPress, Ghost or Joomla!) that automatically detect when your content changes. We also provide extensive documentation on how to integrate Sitesauce with any other platform, either via our API or using webhooks.<br><br>\n
			If your platform can't be integrated with Sitesauce through any of these options, Sitesauce also provides an option to trigger new deployments periodically.

			How is using Sitesauce better than building a static site from scratch?
			How is using Sitesauce better than using a Headless CMS?
			EOL,
            'answer' => <<<EOL
			If you have an existing website, migrating your theme, plugins and content can be a hard task. You'd also lose the simplicity of having an admin panel and allowing multiple users to work on your content together.<br><br>\n
			Part of this problem could be solved by having your static site pull data from your backend on build, but this brings up other problems, like having to manage two different codebases for a single website, migrating your themes over or needing to deploy to preview your content.<br><br>\n
			Sitesauce takes care of all this for you. After signing up and entering a URL, we'll generate a production-ready static version of your website and deploy it. You keep your dashboard and remove unnecesary complexity.
			EOL,

			Will my contact forms work on my static site?
			Will comment sections work work on my static site?
			Will parts of the site that fetch data from the backend work on my static site?
			EOL,
            'answer' => <<<EOL
			Sitesauce recommends the use of JAMstack-friendly alternatives to this services. For example, you could move your contact forms to [StaticKit](https://statickit.com) or your comments to [Commento](https://commento.io).<br><br>\n
			However, there are times where the only option is to rely on your backend. For this, you can configure Sitesauce to proxy certain endpoints to your backend. You can also use this if you need to fetch some data from your backend via AJAX.
