The Sitesauce UI was originally when building the MVP. While I focused on it for quite some time, it still was confusing, messed up some elements and wasn't responsive. So I decided to replace it.

I wanted to rebuild the UI from scratch, that is, deleting my layout files and coding them again‪. Here's how it turned out:

<div className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
    <div className="relative p-0" style={{ paddingTop: '47.19%', margin:'-2px'}}>
        <iframe className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RJu_WL4Tfac" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />
    </div>
</div>

I'm really happy with the result, and it also looks & works great on mobile, it's amazing what you can build in a weekend with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)!

export default props => <Page {...meta} {...props} />
