Let's face it, the UI you have to use to configure proxying and redirects isn't great. It's one of the few pieces that survived from the first redesign, and many users are confused about how to use it. Proxying is one of the most powerful features Sitesauce offers, so it was time to give it some more love.

Today we're launching a new, much cleaner UI for configuring this feature, with improved explanations for what each field does. We've also updated [our documentation](https://sitesauce.app/guides/proxying-and-redirects) to mention and explain our regex support and showcase its power.
