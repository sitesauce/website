Since our launch, Sitesauce has relied on word of mouth to acquire new users and continue growing. To thank everyone who continues to recommend Sitesauce to their friends, coworkers, or followers, today we're launching our Affiliate program.

Invite people to create an account through your link and you'll get a 20% commission for every payment they make, forever!

Any Sitesauce user with an active subscription can now [apply to the program](https://app.sitesauce.app/affiliate) from their dashboard and start earning money from sharing Sitesauce. Let's continue growing together!
