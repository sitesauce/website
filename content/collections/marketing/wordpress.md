    question: |
      Does Sitesauce replace regular hosting?
      Can I run Sitesauce from my development or staging environment?
      Do I need to expose my backend to the internet to use Sitesauce?
    answer: |
      While it's recommended to keep your WordPress instance running somewhere (like a subdomain), as it allows you to continue using your dashboard regularly, you can deploy locally-running sites to Sitesauce using [our CLI](https://sitesauce.app/guides/cli)!<br>
      This means you could have your blog on your computer, run it locally to edit some content then push it to production via Sitesauce without needing to pay for servers!
  -
    question: 'How does Sitesauce detect when my content changes?'
    answer: |
      Sitesauce provides an official WordPress plugin that automatically detects when your content changes and lets us know. Setting it up is as easy as searching for it on the WordPress plugin directory, clicking install and pasting a URL from your Sitesauce dashboard.<br>
      We also allow you to define periodical deployments, which tell us to automatically deploy your site every day, hour or minute.

    question: |
      How is using Sitesauce better than building a static site from scratch?
      How is using Sitesauce better than using a Headless CMS?
    answer: |
      If you have an existing website, migrating your theme, plugins and content can be a hard task. You'd also lose the simplicity of having an admin panel and allowing multiple users to work on your content together.<br>
      Part of this problem could be solved by having your static site pull data from WordPress on build, but this brings up other problems, like having to manage two different codebases for a single website, migrating your themes over or needing to deploy to preview your content.<br>
      Sitesauce takes care of all this for you. After signing up and entering a URL, we'll generate a production-ready static version of your website and deploy it. You keep your dashboard and remove unnecesary complexity.

    question: |
      Will my contact forms work on my static site?
      Will comment sections work work on my static site?
      Will parts of the site that fetch data from the backend work on my static site?
    answer: |
      Sitesauce recommends the use of JAMstack-friendly alternatives to these services. For example, you could move your contact forms to [StaticKit](https://statickit.com) or your comments to [Commento](https://commento.io).<br>
      However, there are times where the only option is to rely on your backend. For this, you can [configure Sitesauce to proxy certain endpoints](https://sitesauce.app/guides/proxying-and-redirects) over to WordPress. You can also use this if you need to fetch some data from your backend via AJAX.

    question: |
      Is Sitesauce production-ready?
      Are any sites currently using Sitesauce on production?
    answer: 'Yes! More than {{ open:sites }} sites have been deployed using Sitesauce to date. The website you''re looking at right now was generated by Sitesauce from a Statamic site. Other examples include [the Branch website](https://branchci.com/?ref=sitesauce), which uses WordPress, and <a href="https://miguelpiedrafita.com" target="_blank" class="border-b border-gray-500 link-mp">Miguel Piedrafita''s personal website</a> alongside many others.'
